This is a shortlist of project that I am interested to do
========

(See [solutions](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects-Solutions)).



**Dijkstra’s Algorithm** - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.

**Text Editor** - Notepad style application that can open, edit, and save text documents. *Optional: Add syntax highlighting and other features.*

**Guestbook / Journal** - A simple application that allows people to add comments or write journal entries. It can allow comments or not and timestamps for all entries. Could also be made into a shout box. *Optional: Deploy it on Google App Engine or Heroku or any other PaaS (if possible, of course).*


Networking
---------

**FTP Program** - A file transfer program which can transfer files back and forth from a remote web sever.

**Bandwidth Monitor** - A small utility program that tracks how much data you have uploaded and downloaded from the net during the course of your current online session. See if you can find out what periods of the day you use more and less and generate a report or graph that shows it.

**Port Scanner** - Enter an IP address and a port range where the program will then attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.

**Mail Checker (POP3 / IMAP)** - The user enters various account information include web server and IP, protocol type (POP3 or IMAP) and the application will check for email at a given interval.

**Country from IP Lookup** - Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. *Optional: Find the Ip automatically.*

**Whois Search Tool** - Enter an IP or host address and have it look it up through whois and return the results to you.

**Site Checker with Time Scheduling** - An application that attempts to connect to a website or server every so many minutes or a given time and check if it is up. If it is down, it will notify you by email or by posting a notice on screen.


Threading
---------

**Create A Progress Bar for Downloads** - Create a progress bar for applications that can keep track of a download in progress. The progress bar will be on a separate thread and will communicate with the main thread using delegates.

**Bulk Thumbnail Creator** - Picture processing can take a bit of time for some transformations. Especially if the image is large. Create an image program which can take hundreds of images and converts them to a specified size in the background thread while you do other things. For added complexity, have one thread handling re-sizing, have another bulk renaming of thumbnails etc.


Web
---------

**Page Scraper** - Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. *Optional: Organize the indexed content and don’t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.*

**Online White Board** - Create an application which allows you to draw pictures, write notes and use various colors to flesh out ideas for projects. *Optional: Add feature to invite friends to collaborate on a white board online.*

**Fetch Current Weather** - Get the current weather for a given zip/postal code. *Optional: Try locating the user automatically.*

**Scheduled Auto Login and Action** - Make an application which logs into a given site on a schedule and invokes a certain action and then logs out. This can be useful for checking web mail, posting regular content, or getting info for other applications and saving it to your computer.



**Quiz Maker** - Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students. Each quiz can be different and then reads a key to grade the quizzes.


**Slide Show** - Make an application that shows various pictures in a slide show format. *Optional: Try adding various effects like fade in/out, star wipe and window blinds transitions.*
